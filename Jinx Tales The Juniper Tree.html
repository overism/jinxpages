                                <strong>The Grimmest of them All</strong> 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Once upon a time, in a quaint village, there lived a loving couple who longed for a child. The wife sat near the window, peeling an apple, when she accidentally cut her finger, and a few drops of blood fell onto the snow outside. She gazed at the contrasting colors and uttered a heartfelt wish, "I wish I had a child as white as snow and as red as blood."
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                To their delight, the woman soon became pregnant and gave birth to a beautiful boy they named Hansel. However, their happiness was short-lived as the mother fell gravely ill and passed away. On her deathbed, she whispered to her husband, "If I die, bury me beneath the juniper tree."
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                After some time, the grieving man remarried, but his new wife was wicked and envious of Hansel. She concocted a sinister plan to eliminate the boy. One day, she lured Hansel into the house, killed him, and cooked him into a stew. She served the gruesome meal to the unsuspecting father.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The wicked stepmother then hid Hansel's bones beneath the juniper tree, believing she had concealed all evidence of her dark deed. However, a strange occurrence took place—the juniper tree began to tremble, and from its branches, a magnificent bird emerged.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This bird sang a haunting and sorrowful song, revealing the murder and the stepmother's wickedness. The eerie melody drew the attention of several passersby, including a cobbler, a goldsmith, and even a king. They followed the song and reached the house.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The bird, still perched upon the juniper tree, dropped a heavy millstone onto the wicked stepmother, instantly ending her life. Hansel's father was devastated upon learning the truth but was overjoyed to be reunited with his resurrected son.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                From that day on, the juniper tree bore golden apples as a symbol of hope and rebirth. The family lived happily ever after, having overcome the darkness that once hung over their home

                                <b size="2px">The Truth Behind "Her Wickedness"</b>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The authors of the Juniper Tree, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm who were commonly known as the Brother Grimm, were commonly known throughout Europe for their dark interpretation of stories that have travelled through generations. They always looked to make stories as accurate as possible with some minor changes to add dark and eerie elements. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The Juniper Tree doesn’t have a well-documented history, and thus the true origin of the story isn’t clear. Despite this, there are some elements of the story which align with many European folk stories, providing an idea that it is from a wider European folk tradition. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Due to this background, there isn’t a clear inspiration for this story, however it has some themes of purification of healing, demonstrated through the magical occurrences revolving around the juniper tree. On the other hand, there are some dark themes of murder, cannibalism, and treachery behind this story, and this is reflected from a large amount of European stories.  While these are used as a warning and to give a lesson, these extremely dark themes prove the Juniper Tree isn’t as happy and positive as the ending makes it seem.
