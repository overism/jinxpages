                                <strong>The Mischief of Greed</strong> 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Once upon a time, there was a poor miller who wanted to impress the king. He told the king that his daughter could spin straw into gold. Intrigued, the king brought the miller's daughter to a room filled with straw and a spinning wheel. He ordered her to spin the straw into gold by morning, threatening her with death if she failed.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The frightened miller's daughter had no idea how to perform such a feat. Alone in the room, she wept in despair. Suddenly, a little man appeared and asked her what she would give him if he spun the straw into gold. She offered her necklace, and the little man used his magical powers to complete the task.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The next night, the king demanded more gold, and the miller's daughter again struck a deal with the little man, offering her ring. He spun the straw into gold in exchange.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                On the third night, the king demanded even more gold and promised to marry the miller's daughter if she succeeded. In desperation, she promised the little man her firstborn child. He agreed and once more turned the straw into gold.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Time passed, and the miller's daughter married the king, eventually giving birth to a beautiful baby. The little man returned to claim the child as per their agreement. The distraught mother offered him great wealth, but he insisted on taking the baby. However, he gave her three days to guess his name.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The queen sent messengers throughout the kingdom, searching for the little man's name. On the third day, they overheard him singing a song about his name, Rumpelstiltskin. The queen gleefully revealed his name, and Rumpelstiltskin was so angry and embarrassed that he stamped his foot and tore himself in two, disappearing forever.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The queen and the king kept their child and lived happily, having learned the value of honesty and the danger of making careless promises.

                                <b size="2px">Rumeplstilskin's Honest Intentions</b>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The Authors of Rumplestiltskin were the Brothers Grimm. Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were commonly known for their authentic stories around Europe, which usually had extremely dark themes. They carried stories through generations and looked to keep the stories as accurate as possible. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The true origins of this story are unclear, however there are some extremely similar versions dating 200 years before the Brothers Grimm version. One such version was called Petrosinella, from Italian poet Giambattista Basille. His story matched up with the woman having to spin straw to gold, a little man helping and having to guess the name of the man.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                There isn’t a clear inspiration for this story, however it does have some common connections with other European folk stories. The archetype of a little magical being is common among European folk tales and he often helps main characters. Rumplestiltskin himself doesn’t have much background information or motivation, however adaptations show that he is wanderer, and is willing to use his magic in exchange of many different types of things. On top of this, it has some extremely important lessons. Bargains and promises can create a major consequence which can ultimately cost the person making the deal.
