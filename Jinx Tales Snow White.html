                                <strong>The Evils of Jealousy</strong> 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Once upon a time, in a kingdom far away, there lived a beautiful queen who wished for a child. Her wish was granted, and she gave birth to a daughter with skin as white as snow, lips as red as roses, and hair as black as ebony. They named her Snow White.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Tragically, the queen died shortly after Snow White's birth, leaving the king heartbroken. Eventually, the king remarried a beautiful but wicked woman who was a powerful sorceress. She possessed a magic mirror and would ask it daily, "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?" For years, the mirror replied that the queen was the fairest. However, as Snow White grew, the mirror declared that Snow White was the fairest in the land.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Consumed by jealousy, the wicked queen ordered a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest, kill her, and bring back her heart as proof. The huntsman couldn't bring himself to do it and told Snow White to flee and hide. Lost and frightened, Snow White found a small cottage deep in the woods that belonged to seven kindhearted dwarfs. They allowed her to stay with them.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The queen, believing Snow White was dead, continued to ask the magic mirror, which still declared Snow White as the fairest. Learning that Snow White was alive, the queen devised a plan. She disguised herself and, on three separate occasions, tricked Snow White into biting a poisoned apple. Each time, Snow White fell into a death-like sleep.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The dwarfs, unable to revive her, placed her in a glass coffin. A prince passing by saw Snow White's beauty and learned of her plight from the dwarfs. He kissed her, breaking the curse, and she awoke. They fell in love, and Snow White was reunited with her father, the king.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The wicked queen, however, met her demise when she attended the wedding of Snow White and the prince. For her evil deeds, she was forced to dance in red-hot iron shoes until she perished.

                                <b size="2px">The Stepmother's Treachery</b>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The Brothers Grimm, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, the writers of Snow White, were well-known throughout Europe for their gloomy retellings of folktales that had been passed down through the ages. They constantly tried to add dark and unsettling components to stories while keeping them as factual as possible. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                While the Brothers Grimm popularised the story, there are many recorded version before them, which makes it difficult to pinpoint the actual original. It gets told in many different ways in different cultures. These stories may have been inspired by German stories with a character called “Sneewittchen” which had similar themes such as a princess with a tragic fate and a wicked stepmother. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The concept of a princess being saved by a magical kiss is a common theme in folklore and mythology in general. A large theme of this story is the jealousy of the stepmother, which puts the entire story into motion. The queen gets so jealous she wants to murder her own step-daughter. Despite a happy ending, this story has some dark themes of murder and jealousy.
